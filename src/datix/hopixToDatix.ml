(** A closure compilation environment relates an identifier to the way
    it is accessed in the compiled version of the function's
    body.

    Indeed, consider the following example. Imagine that the following
    function is to be compiled:

    fun x -> x + y

    In that case, the closure compilation environment will
    contain:

    x -> x
    y -> "the code that extract the value of y from the closure environment"

    Indeed, "x" is a local variable that can be accessed directly in
    the compiled version of this function's body whereas "y" is a free
    variable whose value must be retrieved from the closure's
    environment.
